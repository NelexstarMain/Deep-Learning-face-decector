# Facial Recognition System

## Overview

This Python project implements a facial recognition system for user identification. It leverages pre-trained deep learning models and provides functionalities for data preparation, user profile creation, and real-time face recognition.

## Key Features

* **Data Preparation:** Simplifies the process of organizing and preparing facial image datasets for training.
* **User Profile Creation:** Allows users to easily create profiles with captured face images.
* **Real-Time Face Recognition:** Utilizes a pre-trained model to identify faces from a webcam stream.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (cv2)
* NumPy (np)
* Pickle
* TensorFlow (tf)
* Scikit-learn (sklearn) (optional, for model training)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/NelexstarMain/Deep-Learning-face-decector.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
 pip install opencv-python numpy pickle tensorflow scikit-learn
```
